### Using with ReactJS 
Supported versions: 14,15,16+  
We have simple wrapper for ReactJS please take a look at [framepay-react](https://github.com/Rebilly/framepay-react)

If you want to use the framepay without the `framepay-react` package, you could take a look at the example [framepay-preact-direct-integration](https://codesandbox.io/s/framepay-preact-direct-integration-irbi4)
