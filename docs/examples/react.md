### Using with ReactJS 
Supported versions: 14,15,16+  
We offer an easy-to-use wrapper component for ReactJS, called [framepay-react](https://github.com/Rebilly/framepay-react).

---

`framepay-react` is the easiest way to integrate framepay into your React project. However, if you prefer to use framepay directly, you can look at the example [framepay-preact-direct-integration](https://codesandbox.io/s/framepay-preact-direct-integration-irbi4)
