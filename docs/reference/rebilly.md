# Rebilly Namespace

Under the `Rebilly` namespace you will find methods for initializing FramePay and creating payment tokens from a form.

## initialize

Use this method to configure FramePay with your publishable API key and customize the look and feel of elements generated by FramePay.

It accepts a single `configuration` object.
```js
Rebilly.initialize(configuration);
```

The `configuration` must contain at a `publishableKey` otherwise an error will be thrown. It can optionally define CSS styles and class names to overwrite the style of FramePay.
