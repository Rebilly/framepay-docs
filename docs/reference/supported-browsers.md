# Supported browsers

FramePay strives to support all recent versions of major browsers.  
Because of security reasons, the FramePay doesn't support the browsers that are no longer receiving security updates and represent a small part of the traffic.

- We support all major versions of the Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Opera
- We support Internet Explorer/Edge per [Microsoft's lifecycle policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer).   
  We currently support IE10 and above.
- We respond to bug reports but do not proactively test all mobile browsers on all platforms.  
  Except major versions of the Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Opera.

If you have an issue with FramePay on a specific browser,  
Please contact us so we can improve its support (Use Intercom or [github-issue](https://github.com/Rebilly/framepay-docs/issues/new))

> Please do not use the github-issues for the security bugs
